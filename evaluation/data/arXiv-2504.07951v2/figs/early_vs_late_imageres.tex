    \caption{\textbf{Early vs late fusion: training with different image
    resolutions (isoFLOPs).} For the same training FLOPs we vary the image
    resolution (and thus the number of image tokens) during training and report
    the final training loss. Increasing resolution, hurts the performance on
    text and interleaved documents, while helping image captioning. The gap
    stays almost the same on text and interleaved data while slightly increase
    on image captioning in favor of early fusion.}
