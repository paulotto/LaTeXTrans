\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this study presents TRODO, a robust and general method for scanning and identifying trojaned classifiers with low time and resource complexity. TRODO's strength lies in its ability to detect trojans in diverse scenarios, including those involving adversarially trained models. Interestingly, TRODO is applicable even in scenarios where no data is available. Our experimental results demonstrate TRODO's superior performance, achieving high accuracy across various attack types and benchmark datasets. The adaptability and effectiveness of our approach mark a significant advancement in enhancing the reliability and security of deep neural networks in critical applications.
