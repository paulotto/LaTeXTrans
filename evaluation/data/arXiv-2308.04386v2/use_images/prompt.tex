	\caption{
	    Prompt templates of the single and multi-aspect evaluation.
		Single-aspect evaluation means that the model only needs to consider a specific aspect during the evaluation process.
		Conversely, multi-aspect evaluation means that the model must consider multiple aspects concurrently, e.g., simultaneously considering meaning preservation and grammar to assign stars. Template portions \sethlcolor{LightBlue}\hl{highlighted in blue} denote the reference input used only by reference-based evaluation, and that those \sethlcolor{Wheat}\hl{highlighted in yellow} denote the differentiation between single-aspect evaluation and multi-aspect evaluation.
