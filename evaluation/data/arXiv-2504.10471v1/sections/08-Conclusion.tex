\section{Conclusion}

We introduce the Massive Image Embedding Benchmark (MIEB), which consists of 8 task categories with 130 individual tasks covering 38 languages. We benchmark 50 models on MIEB, providing baselines and insights for future research. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating vision embeddings beyond classification and retrieval, and their role in facilitating multimodal generative models.
