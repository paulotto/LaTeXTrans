\section{Conclusion}
In this position paper, we have identified key tasks at the heart of AI for software engineering as well as a set of three measures to classify different realizations of these tasks. We have also highlighted critical cross-cutting challenges that permeate throughout many tasks. Finally, to drive progress in AI for code, we've pinpointed a set of exciting and promising research directions for alleviating these challenges and advancing AI towards being a more capable software engineer.  We hope this work provides valuable insights about the current landscape of AI for software engineering and encourages future research in these directions. By building on these insights, we are optimistic that the community can work toward developing AI-driven solutions that better support software engineers in real-world settings.

% We hope that our work leaves readers optimistic and hopeful about future progress in AI for code, whether it be in research or in engineering.
