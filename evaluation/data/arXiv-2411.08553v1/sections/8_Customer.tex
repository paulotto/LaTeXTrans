\section{Customer Problem Statement}
The availability of robust datasets is crucial for understanding customer behaviors, preferences, and trends, enabling Amazon to deliver tailored solutions and services. The deficiency of good quality datasets impedes building effective solutions to address customer problems. To overcome these challenges and enhance customer satisfaction, we propose CorrSynth which is capable of generating diverse and better quality datasets. Our approach can be generalized to any text classification dataset with which machine learning solutions can be bootstrapped and result in competitive performance.
