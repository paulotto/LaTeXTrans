\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we explore the landscape of personalization from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to advanced LLM-based Agents, detailing adaptations across pre-retrieval, retrieval, and generation stages while extending into agentic capabilities. By reviewing recent literature, datasets, and metrics, we highlight the progress and diversity in enhancing user satisfaction through tailored AI systems. 
However, challenges such as scalability, effective evaluation, and ethical concerns underscore the need for innovative solutions. Future research should focus on lightweight frameworks, specialized benchmarks, and privacy-preserving techniques to advance personalized AI. 
Relevant papers and resources are also compiled online for ease of future research.
