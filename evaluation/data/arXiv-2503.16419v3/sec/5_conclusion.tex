\section{Conclusion}

This paper provides the first structured survey of efficient reasoning in LLMs, categorizing existing approaches into three areas: model-based, reasoning output-based, and input prompts-based methods. Additionally, it discusses efficient data utilization, reasoning capabilities of smaller models, evaluation techniques, and benchmarking, accompanied by a continuously updated public repository to support future research. Crucially, efficient reasoning approaches offer significant practical benefits across various domains: reducing computational costs in healthcare diagnostics, enhancing real-time decision-making and safety in autonomous driving, boosting the reliability and usefulness of embodied AI systems, and enabling quicker, more profitable responses in financial algorithmic trading and risk assessment. These advancements highlight the broad economic and societal value of efficient reasoning in LLMs.
