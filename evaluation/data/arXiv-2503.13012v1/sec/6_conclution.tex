\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents a novel multi-matching framework for TTDG, which leverages universe embeddings to incorporate morphological priors from medical images while ensuring cycle-consistency, along with an unsupervised test-time paradigm that fully integrates these priors for efficient adaptation.
Extensive experiments, including comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate that our graph-matching-based approach achieves SOTA performance, outperforming entropy-based, template-based, batch normalization-based, and noise estimation-based methods across both multi-source and single-source domain generalization tasks.
