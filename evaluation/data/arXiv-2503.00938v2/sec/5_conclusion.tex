\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a training-free person re-identification framework that fully leverages the natural clustering behavior of features around the identity center during the training process. By introducing the concept of feature centralization, we effectively reduced noise in individual samples and enhanced identity representation without model training. Our approach includes an identity-guided pedestrian generation paradigm, capable of producing high-quality, multi-pose images with consistent identity features, even under challenging conditions such as visible, infrared, and occlusion scenarios. The neighbor feature centralization algorithm also preserves feature's original distribution while mining potential positive samples. It can also be flexibly integrated with existing re-ranking methods.
