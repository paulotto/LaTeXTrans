\section*{Limitations}
% Despite significant contributions to mitigating dataset biases, the proposed work has the following limitations: 
% although 
Though our framework outperforms baselines, there is still room for improvement on Stress and OOD test sets.   
In addition, we didn't analyze the generalizability of the approach to other NLP domains or tasks beyond the three tasks used in the experiments.  
% Moreover, the framework introduces additional computational complexity due to the perturbation operations and contrastive learning objective, which may increase the training time. 
% Finally, our experiments are mainly conducted on two encoder models and it's effect on other learner has not been explored.
