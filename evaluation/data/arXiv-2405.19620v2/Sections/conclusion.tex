\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{conclusion}

\paragraph{Conclusion.} In this work, we explore the sparse scene representation and review the task design in the realm of end-to-end autonomous driving. The resulting end-to-end paradigm SparseDrive achieves both remarkable performance and high efficiency. We hope the impressive performance of SparseDrive can inspire the community to rethink the task design for end-to-end autonomous driving and promote technological progress in this field.

\paragraph{Future work.} There still are some limitations in our work. First, the performance of our end-to-end model still falls behind the single-task method, for example, the online mapping task. Second, the scale of the dataset is not large enough to exploit the full potential of end-to-end autonomous driving, and the open-loop evaluation cannot comprehensively represent the model performance. We leave these problems for future exploration.
